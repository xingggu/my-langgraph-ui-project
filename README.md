# LangGraph + React UI Demo

This project demonstrates how to build a LangGraph-based agent with dynamic React UI rendering.

## Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI server with LangGraph agent
- `frontend/`: React components powered by LangGraph SDK

## How to Run

1. Start the backend:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 2024
```

2. Start your frontend dev server (e.g., with Next.js, Vite, etc.)
